    <h1 class="section">What is Studio Series?</h1>
    <p class="content">Transformers: Studio Series is a line produced by Hasbro and TakaraTomy in partnership with Paramount
        Pictures. Started in 2018, the line set off to produce figures from the Live Action Transformers movies with
        accuracy to scale and CGI model in mind. In 2021, the line opened its doors to characters who appeared in
        The Transformers: The Movie, released in 1986 under the subline Studio Series 86. As the line developed, it
        then welcomed several new sublines and size groups such as: Core Class, Commander Class, and the exclusive
        subline Buzzworthy Bumblebee. More notably, the line once more opened its doors to characters who have
        concept art for the movies, and a new subline called Studio Series- Gamer Edition, which focuses on
        characters from the multitude of Transformers games, starting with Transformers: War For Cybertron published
        by High Moon Studios. As the line continues to evolve it will continue to serve its original intention of
        allowing fans to recreate iconic scenes from the movies, games, and any other new media entries the line may
        see in the future.</p>
